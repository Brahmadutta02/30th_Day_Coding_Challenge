                <p>The Sahara is a desert on the African continent. 
                    With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres, 
                    it is the largest hot desert in the world and the 
                    third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the 
                    deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic. </p>

                    <p>The Western Desert of Egypt is an area of the 
                        Sahara that lies west of the river Nile, up to 
                        the Libyan border, and south from the 
                        Mediterranean Sea to the border with Sudan. 
                        It is named in contrast to the Eastern Desert 
                        which extends east from the Nile to the Red Sea.</p>

                    <p>Located close to other sites in the Kharga Oasis, 
                        the Christian Cemetery of Al Bagawat is a unique 
                        and fairly unknown attraction to see in Egypt. 
                        Since many people do not know about this, it is 
                        not crowded and certainly worth seeing.</p>
